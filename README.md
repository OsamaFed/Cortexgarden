# Cortexgarden ðŸŒ³

Cortexgarden is a web-based platform that offers cognitive and logic games designed to enhance focus, reasoning, and memory through interactive quizzes and mental exercises.  
This project was developed to apply what I have recently learned in **Next.js**, including app routing, state management, and modular component design.

---

## Overview

Cortexgarden combines modern web technologies to deliver a dynamic and responsive game experience.  
It uses **Next.js App Router** for routing and APIs, **React** for UI components, and **Redux Toolkit** for centralized state management.  
The application also supports light and dark themes, and utilizes efficient caching for smooth gameplay.

### Purpose
Cortexgarden was created as a personal project to practice and showcase the concepts I recently learned in **Next.js**, **React**, and **Redux Toolkit**.  
The goal was to integrate modern web technologies into a single, maintainable, and interactive application that focuses on cognitive and logic-based games.
